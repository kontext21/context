Welcome! This is a curated collection of resources around capturing &amp; processing user context from computer screens and beyond.

# Motivation 
Context matters. Providing it is painful.

No human user should be forced to repeat themselves. That's what computers are made for. It's the 21st century, yet we are still forced to work with old-school software that is heavily siloed. Users have to repeat inputs, rely on copy & paste, import/export or in the best case integegration via APIs.

What if all software could acess all other software that you use? 

Microsoft's Office 97 Clippy "Are you writing a letter?" Was the right idea at the **wrong time**.

**Now is the right time.** If you are an innovator and excited about empowering your user with context, you came to the right place.

# Stages
1. **Capture** - Ingest raw data from the source
2. **Pre-Process** - Clean, enrich, transform the data
3. **Contextualize** - Add meaning to the data. Merge different sources, do enrichment like entity recognition & aggregation.
4. **Act** - Use the data to take action, optionally store it for later.
